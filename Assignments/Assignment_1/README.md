## Computational Neuroscience Assignment 1 Report

This repository contains the report for the Computational Neuroscience Assignment 1, which explores the behavior of the Hodgkin Huxley model and its significance in computational neuroscience. The report is divided into the following sections:

1. Introduction
   - Overview of the Hodgkin Huxley model and its significance in computational neuroscience.
   - Brief explanation of the objectives and scope of the assignment.

2. Methodology
   - Description of the Hodgkin Huxley model equations and their significance in simulating the behavior of neurons.
   - Explanation of the numerical methods and algorithms used for simulating the model.
   - Details of the Python implementation of the model and the functions used for calculating membrane potentials and action potentials.

3. Threshold Values and Action Potential Generation
   - Description of the threshold values I1, I2, and I3 in the context of the Hodgkin Huxley model.
   - Systematic exploration of the behavior of the neuron at different external current values, including the transition from sub-threshold to supra-threshold firing.
   - Analysis of the membrane potential dynamics and the relationship with the opening and closing of sodium channels.

4. Firing Rate Dynamics
   - Explanation of the firing rate dynamics as the external current is varied.
   - Division of the dynamics into sub-threshold, threshold, saturation, and distortion/ceasing regions.
   - Discussion of the implications of extremely high levels of external current on the firing rate and potential distortion of action potentials.

5. Graphical Representation
   - Instructions for plotting a graph depicting the firing rate (frequency) as a function of the applied external current.
   - Explanation of the significance of the graph in visualizing the behavior of the Hodgkin Huxley model.

6. Conclusion
   - Summary of the key findings related to the threshold values, action potential generation, and firing rate dynamics.
   - Reflection on the implications of the results for understanding the behavior of neurons and the Hodgkin Huxley model.

7. Appendix
   - Inclusion of the function used for the simulation and a separate file containing the complete code for the assignment.
