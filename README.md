# Computational-Neuroscience

This repository contains code and analysis from the BT6270: Computational Neuroscience course taken in July - September 2023. The repository explores various neuronal models and their dynamics through simulations and analysis.

## Hodgkin-Huxley Model
* Implemented the Hodgkin-Huxley model, a biophysically detailed model of neuronal action potentials.
* Simulated the model under various applied current conditions to explore the effects on neuronal firing patterns.
* Analyzed the results to understand the relationship between current injection and neuronal behavior.

## FitzHugh-Nagumo Model
* Implemented the two-variable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, a simpler representation of neuronal dynamics.
* Used forward Euler integration to simulate the FHN model and analyze its behavior.
* Compared and contrasted the dynamics of the FHN model with the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

## Hopf Oscillator Network
* Developed and implemented a network of Hopf oscillators, a model for studying oscillatory behavior in neural systems.
* Analyzed the network's behavior, focusing on complex and power coupling phenomena in multidimensional aperiodic signals.
* Explored the network's dynamics under various conditions to understand how coupling influences network behavior.

## Code Structure
The repository may be organized based on the specific models explored (e.g., `hodgkin_huxley`, `fitzhugh_nagumo`, `hopf_oscillator`).
Each subfolder might contain:
- Python scripts implementing the models and simulations.
- Data files generated from the simulations.
- Analysis scripts or notebooks for visualizing and interpreting the results.
